  TO DO
  
  ✔ re: 'sphereize', the problem exists of needing to average
         normals AFTER the shape is sphereized, as the degree is
         not known prior. Normal averaging is computationally
         expensive, so a solution, in the context of pre-built shapes,
         is to provide an optional function "AverageNormals", and
         instruct users that sphereized shapes may use it, for
         reflections etc.
  
  ✔ re-export 'new shapes' with unit size
  ✔ fix color mix
  ✔ come up with solution for averaging normals (for phong etc), with prebuilt shapes
  
  ✔ sprites [transparent rectangle?]
  
  ✔ make uniforms: position, normal etc vec3, vs separate floats
  
  * lights
    └> ✔ ambient
       *  point
       *  directional
  
  * geometry
    └> ✔ generalize geometry function
       ✔ add shapeTypes: torus, cylinder
       *  add method / shapeType for points/particles, lines
       *  noise functions / deformation methods
       ✔ return "raw" geometry with inbuilt shapes, for 2d context
       ✔ add 3-axis 'scale' function 
       
  ✔ README.md
    └> ✔  add remaining exposed methods (e.g. color conversions, spatial)
          as "supplemental"
  
  ✔ add renderer object
  ✔ add camera object
  ✔ fix FOV
  ✔ README.md / documentation
  
  * sprite sheet system / import basic+custom slicing
  ✔ add video texture capabilities
  * cache for API, to include all network-callable items
  
  * shapes
    └> ✔ add shapes (in addtion to Cube)
       ✔ make non-cube UVs equirectangular
       ✔ keep shape generation functions, but add 'precompiled' versions for ordinary calls
       ✔ move rotation function into shader
       * loading -> compression, direct output of
                    usable format (no further processing needed)

  * subdivision
    └> ✔  add optional LOD param for all basic geometry
       ✔ decouple polygons from UV subdivision (interpolate UVs @ sub)
       
  * shaders / textures
    └> ✔ move shaders into Coordinates module
       *  bloom shader
       *  add '# tiling (x/y)' option
       ✔  phong -> play nice with rectangle
       ✔  move camera into vertex shader
       ✔  create pseudo-phong shader
       ✔  add 'reflectivity' & texture input for it
       ✔  flat/smooth shading
       ✔  integrate optional effect shaders

  * functions / methods
    └> ✔ begin separating module functions as optional includes
       ✔ migrate functions to coordinates.js module
       ✔ integrate obj loader
